Notes and tips
- Open the site in a local development server (e.g., VS Code Live Server) to test component fetch and to mirror production behavior.
- Replace placeholder images and text with your real content.
- Keep the `assets/components/` folder for common partials you can reuse on other pages.

Git & Deploy
- See the git-steps.md for instructions on how to commit and deploy to GitHub Pages.
